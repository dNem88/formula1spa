Both Aston Martin and Ferrari have committed heavily to gill cooling on the upper surface of their sidepods - something allowed for the first time since it was banned in 2009 - while others have directed it through tunnels to exit from big outlets at the back of the car. The hot air, which has just been through the radiators, is aerodynamically not useful. Its energy has been spent and the contrast in temperature with the ambient air creates a very disruptive flow. This is why neither the Ferrari nor Aston Martin feature the heavy downward ramp of some other cars where the downward inclination is used to accelerate the airflow to the space between the rear wheels and the diffuser exits of the venturi tunnels. Instead, they have heavily undercut sidepods to do that job, leaving the top surface to vent the hot air in a relatively harmless area.",(0,m.jsx)("br",{}),(0,m.jsx)("br",{}),"In the cars with conventional cooling exits at the rear - usually around either side of the exhaust tailpipe - the air is being directed around the beam wing.",(0,m.jsx)("br",{}),"Another key point of divergence is that of front suspension packaging.
